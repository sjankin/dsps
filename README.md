# Data Science in Public Sector #


### Big Data and Analytics Summer School 
#### BD009 Data science for public policy

[Slava Mikhaylov](s.mikhaylov@essex.ac.uk), Institute for Analytics and Data Science, Department of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Department of Government, University of Essex  

### Overview

Public sector organisations increasingly express interest in using data science capabilities to develop and deliver policy, and generate efficiencies in high uncertainty environments. While public organisations successfully utilize standard data sources (e.g. surveys), there are many opportunities in generating additional value for organisations from large volumes of unstructured data (e.g. textual data from consultations and consumer feedback) and new forms of data (e.g. from smart energy meters).  This is an applied course, where we build on the material covered in other modules and focus on the application of these concepts in the specific context of public policy analysis. 

The course is interactive, with a hands-on computer lab, in which participants will work through three analytical projects covering the application of machine learning techniques (topic models, clustering, predictive modelling) to the policies at the EU and UK levels. 
We will also focus on the critical issues of reproducibility of analytical results using R Notebooks and presentation of results to stakeholders with R Markdown.


### Preparing for the course

Before the course you should:

* Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) _and_ [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) on your computer.
*	Install Rtools for Windows machines from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). If you are using OS X, you will need to to install XCode, available for free from the App Store. This will install a compiler (if you don't have a compiler installed) which will be needed when installing packages from GitHub that require compilation from C++ source code.
* Make sure you have at least R 3.3.3 installed. (The latest version of R, as of 23 May 2017, is 3.4.0.)
* Make sure your packages are up-to-date. From the command line, run `update.packages(ask = FALSE)`
* Install `quanteda` from CRAN. From the `Packages` pane in RStudio, or from the command line: `install.packages("quanteda")`
* Install `readtext` from GitHub, following [these instructions](https://github.com/kbenoit/readtext/blob/master/README.md)
* Try creating and "knitting" an RMarkdown file. You can run the attached [test.Rmd](start/test.Rmd) file, and if builds without error and looks like this [test.html](start/test.html) then you have successfully configured your system. If asked by RStudio, install all needed packages.
* Set up a GitHub account and install necessary packages following discussion in Hadley Wickham's "R Packages" [Git and GitHub chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)



#### Instructions for use of course materials

You have three options for downloading the course material found on this page:  

1.  You can download the materials by clicking on each link.  

2.  You can "clone" repository, using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop".  If you do not have a git client installed on your system, you will need to [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  This is preferred, since you can refresh your clone as new content gets pushed to the course repository.  (And new material will get actively pushed to the course repository at least once per day as this course takes place.)

3.  Statically, you can choose the button on the right marked "Download zip" which will download the entire repository as a zip file.

You can also subscribe to the repository if you have [a GitHub account](https://github.com), which will send you updates each time new changes are pushed to the repository.
